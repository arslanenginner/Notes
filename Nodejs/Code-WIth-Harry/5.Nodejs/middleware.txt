A middleware is fun that run before any request,  have request and respose object to send,
let susspose we have multiple middlewares so first we use for logging the client request other or another work etc.

Order is important in middleware so middleware that run later will execure code 

1. Application level middleware (app.use)
2. Router Level middleware  (work in specific router)
3. Error Handling middleware  ( handle error and what do next)
4. Built in middleware 
    static files    (handle static files)
    json files      (parse encoming request in json)
    Urlencoded      (parse encoming request with url encoded paylaod)

5. Third party middleware  (use others middleware)
