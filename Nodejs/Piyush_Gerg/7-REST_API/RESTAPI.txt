         *** Restfull API ***
Rules/Best practicies:
1. work as server and client (both are no dependent on each other)
     if client accept htm such as browser so
        HTML (created on server ) SSR(server side render) ==>  sent to client

     if data sent in format of json or XML
        Data sent by server in format ==> client read raw data and render on his screen

2. Always respect all HTTP methods
     Get /getuser      //why using get name again
     POST /updateuser  //why using update name again
